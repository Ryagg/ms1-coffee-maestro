User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development

The project features a static website where barista courses are offered for purchase.

The site targets both private citizens who want to extend their knowledge about coffee and to learn new methods of preparation as well as aspiring baristas who want to make a career out of their passion for coffee.

## User Experience (UX)

For user personas and stories I conducted short qualitative interviews with colleagues, friends and family. I used the results to generate five user personas. Two of them are different kind of online shoppers and the remaining three personas are coffee drinkers with varying goals for visiting the site.

### User personas (list beneath)

- Persona1: casual coffee drinker
- Persona2: coffee enthusiast
- Persona3: aspiring barista
- Persona4: frequent online shopper
- Persona5: sporadic online shopper

For these personas I created the following user stories:

#### As a frequent online shopper I want

- to quickly find out how I can contact customer support so that I don’t have to look for long if I have to contact them
- easy return options for the product so that  I don’t have to spend too much time if I want to return the product
- several payment options so that I can choose the option that best fits my requirements

#### As a sporadic online shopper I want

- to be able to place orders on account so that I can be sure that I’m not being scammed
- to quickly find my way around the page so that I don’t get lost
- to buy directly from the manufacturer so that I support small vendors/suppliers
- to see product ratings/evaluations from other customers so that I can be sure that the product meets my requirements

#### As a casual coffee drinker I want

- to gift a course to a friend so that I can make him/her happy

#### As a coffee enthusiast I want

- to learn how to make specialty coffees so that I can prepare a greater variety of coffees and also impress my friends

#### An an aspiring barista I want

- to find an affordable, certified barista course so that I improve my chances of getting a job a a barista

### Site owners Goals

## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

For fonts, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to compare various designs. I chose Yanone Kaffeesatz as my primary display typeface. I wanted to recreate the style and allure of coffee houses from the 1920s. Additionally, being used on coffee and food-related packaging worldwide adds a subliminal familiarity. As secondary font I chose Roboto to add both a strong, but nice contrast and a modern touch.
